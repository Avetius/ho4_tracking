					Renters Compliance Portal is a one-size- fits-all solution for tracking resident’s renters’ insurance policies. RCP instructional materials will be available in the community leasing office for existing and new residents. Residents during the leasing or renewal process will be provided an informational document with pertinent RCP instructions. The RCP instructions shall include a sample declaration the resident can give to their insurance provider (with the address, approved coverages, amounts, etc.)
