                    Why does Renters Compliance Portal need to be listed on my certificate of insurance and can it make changes to my policy?
                </h2>
                <p class="">
                    Renters Compliance Portal is required to be listed on the evidence of coverage so that we receive notice should your policy cancel or other coverage requirements change during the term of your apartment lease. Adding an “additional interest”, “interested party” or “certificate holder” to your policy does not allow that group to make changes on your policy.
                </p>

                <h2 class="bold-title">
                    If my insurance company won’t add Renters Compliance Portal as an “interested party” or “certificate holder” do I have to purchase insurance from a different company?

                    How will I know when my Renters Insurance has been approved and the lease charge has been removed?
                </h2>
                <p class="">
                    Once your Renters Insurance policy is uploaded to the website, you will receive an email confirmation that your insurance has been approved or rejected. If the evidence of coverage doesn’t meet the property’s requirement’s you will be notified of the missing requirement(s) via email. A Renters Compliance Portal representative can assist you in making the necessary changes to your policy.
