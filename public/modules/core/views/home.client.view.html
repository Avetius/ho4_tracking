					<p class="thumbnail-content">Renters Compliance Portal (RCP) creates a seamless way for you to provide your proof of insurance that is required by your Apartment Community.  We will keep track of your certificate and communicate with you and your Community Manager to keep you both protected during your lease term.  Our goal at RCP is to take the worry and headache of keeping track of your certificate of insurance so you can spend your time enjoying your apartment home.</p>

					<p class="thumbnail-content">	To get started simply click the link above "Get Started Now". Residents may also call (866)395 -1308 with questions and/or fax their policy declaration page to (801)763-1374. RCP will review the policy for appropriate coverage, term of policy and proper listing of the community as an interested party, additional insured or certificate holder. RCP then confirms policy acceptance to your Apartment Community.</p>

					<h3 class="media-heading">FOR PROPERTY MANAGERS</h3>
					<p class="thumbnail-content">Renters Compliance Portal (RCP) partners with many Property Management companies to assist in monitoring rentersâ€™ insurance policies. An RCP marketing piece will be available to residents with instructions to provide proof of coverage. RCP will monitor and track all policies.</p>
					<p class="thumbnail-content">Should a policy term expire or should a resident terminate a policy prematurely, the community will be notified immediately by RCP. The community can choose to enroll the unit without coverage into the Renters Legal Liability Program (RLL). Your asset is never left unprotected. Resident may provide a reinstated or new policy to have unit removed from the RLL Program.</p>
