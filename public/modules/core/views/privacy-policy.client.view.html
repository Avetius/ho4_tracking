                <p class="">
                    A “cookie”, also known as a web cookie, browser cookie, and HTTP cookie, is a piece of text stored by a user&#39;s web browser. Our website uses cookies in some controlled instances.  An example of when that would be applicable is; if you are browsing our website and a survey populates, and you state that you do not want to take the survey now or on future visits. You can always disable cookies for our website but this will enable our websites ability to save preferences for you in the future. If our domain is not remembering specific requests (i.e. that you do not want to take a survey in the future) it may be due to a system-specific identification change.
